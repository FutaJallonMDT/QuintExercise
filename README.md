# QuintExercise
I created this project using specflow Nunit, Playwright with C# as it is ideal framework template used in most organisations and its ease of use coupled with the fast rising playwright for stability in test automation due to its auto wait mechanism.
Dependensies used within this framework include : A. Specflow NUnit, Playwright NUnit, Nunit/Test Adapter Amongst others
I adopted page object architechture due to it ease of use.
Directories include : 1. Drivers > DriverHelpers (This class holds the object reporsitory for IPlaywright|IBrowser|IPage) 2. Features > Loan.feature (This file holds the scenario under test) 3. Hooks > BaseHooks (This class is responsible for inistiallising the test and finishing the test off) 4. Pages (This is responsible for housing all the elements used within the test mapped to each pages) 5. Step defefinition > LoanstepDefinition (This class contans coresponding step binding for the scenario steps in the feature file.) 6. Support > env (This is a resourse file which allows me to store my url).
